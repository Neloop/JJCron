            JJCronRM is management JavaFX application for JJCron instances.
            Connection between UI and cron is managed through
            <b>RMI</b> Java technology thus application can be used for remote
            management of huge number of concurent connections. Manager can be
            used for listing tasks on particular instance, adding task,
            deleting task and permanently save all changes. Other handy features
            can be shutdown instance or pause all execution.
        </p>
        <p>
            JJCronRM uses official Java dialogs which available since
            <b>Java 8u40</b>, be sure this version is installed before running
            application.

        <h2>Main features</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>Modifying of particular task is not possible</li>

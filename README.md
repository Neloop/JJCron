**JJCron** is cron-like program written in `Java` which can be used to periodically execute given tasks. **JJCron** can serve as standalone program and also as library used in another application. From the beginning the whole architecture was meant to be modular, easy to use and simple to understand. This is managed by delicate design of internal structures and classes.

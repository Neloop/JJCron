        <p>
            JJCronRM is management JavaFX application for JJCron instances.
            Connection between UI and cron is managed through
            <b>RMI</b> Java technology thus application can be used for remote
            management of huge number of concurent connections. Manager can be
            used for listing tasks on particular instance, adding task,
            deleting task and permanently save all changes. Other handy features
            can be shutdown instance or pause all execution.
        </p>
        <p>
            JJCronRM uses official Java dialogs which available since
            <b>Java 8u40</b>, be sure this version is installed before running
            application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before using JJCronRM its advised to read carefully all information
            about
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JJCron/JJCron">
                JJCron
            </a> first.
        </p>
        <h2>Main features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All code written in pure Java using cutting edge Java 8
                version</li>
            <li>Thanks to Java JJCronRM is multiplatform</li>
            <li>Management of instances over the network using RMI
                technology</li>
            <li>List all tasks from instace, delete task, add task or make your
                changes permanent</li>
            <li>Shutdown instance or simply pause all execution</li>
            <li>And all features of JJCron itself...</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Managing of multiple instances at once is not implemented
                (e.g. add one task to multiple instances)</li>
            <li>Very simple and rigorous graphical layout</li>
            <li>Modifying of particular task is not possible</li>
            <li>Whole functionality is very low-level and users have to
                understand how JJCron and crons in general works</li>
            <li>All drawback from JJCron are inherited here...</li>
        </ul>

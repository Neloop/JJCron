            JJCron - Just a Java Cron is cron-like program written in Java
            which can be used to periodically execute given tasks.
            JJCron is standalone application with cron function
            but can be also used as library for executing tasks
            in other programs. This can be done through modular and lightweight
            desing of internal architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whole application was developed using <b>Netbeans IDE</b>
            with <b>Java 8</b> language standard. Under lesser versions program
            do not have to compile properly. Due to <b>Java</b> usage whole
            application is multiplatform and can be used on whatever system
            <b>Java</b> can run.
        </p>
        <p>
            JJCron provides basic <b>cron</b> functionality without some special
            features concerning <b>crontab</b> configuration. But in addition
            some functionality is added. For instance there is seconds time unit
            column in <b>crontab</b> for even more delicate scheduling.
            Another improvement is that <b>Java</b> classes can be defined
            in <b>crontab</b> loaded and scheduled just as normal <b>cron</b>
            tasks. This is achieved by putting name of class between
            <b>class</b> XML tags.
        </p>
        <h2>Crontab</h2>
        <p>
            Scheduled tasks are handed over to JJCron with <b>crontab</b>
            configuration file. Format of this configurations is standard
            and very similar to actual <b>crontab</b> used
            in proper <b>cron</b> implementations.
        </p>
        <p>Example of crontab format:</p>
        <pre style="background-color:gainsboro;padding:10px;">
<code> #  ┌──────────── sec (0 - 59)
 #  │ ┌───────────── min (0 - 59)
 #  │ │ ┌────────────── hour (0 - 23)
 #  │ │ │ ┌─────────────── day of month (1 - 31)
 #  │ │ │ │ ┌──────────────── month (1 - 12)
 #  │ │ │ │ │ ┌───────────────── day of week (1 - 7) (1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday)
 #  │ │ │ │ │ │
 #  │ │ │ │ │ │
 #  * * * * * *  command to execute</code></pre>

        <h2>Main features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All code written in pure Java using cutting edge
                Java 8 version</li>
            <li>Thanks to Java JJCron is multiplatform</li>
            <li>Modular and lightweight desing</li>
            <li>Easy to understand and use</li>
            <li>Java classes can be used as tasks and can be scheduled
                to execution</li>
            <li>Will be further improved to support RMI remote management</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Not all features from crontab standard format
                are implemented</li>
            <li>Day of week time unit is a bit non-standard
                with its ordering</li>
            <li>Due to Java restrictions only single program can be executed
                (that means no pipes, redirections or program chaining)</li>
            <li>Test are not written yet!</li>
        </ul>
